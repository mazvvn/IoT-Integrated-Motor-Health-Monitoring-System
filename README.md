Overview: This project monitors temperature, vibration, and RPM (rotation per minute) using various sensors. If the temperature exceeds a threshold, a buzzer and red LED are activated. Vibration is counted, and the vibration level is displayed with a green LED. The RPM is detected using a Hall effect sensor, and a yellow LED indicates the RPM readings. The data is displayed on an LCD screen and sent via Serial to monitor these parameters.
